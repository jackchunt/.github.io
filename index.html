         <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro is a Portuguese soccer superstar. By 2003 — when he was just 16 years old — 
         Manchester United paid £12 million (over $14 million U.S. dollars) to sign him, a record fee for a player of his age.He set a franchise record for goals scored in 2008, 
         before Real Madrid paid a record $131 million for his services the following year. 
         Among his many accomplishments, he has won a record-tying five Ballon d'Or awards for player of the year, 
         and led Portugal to an emotional victory in the 2016 European Championship. In July 2018, Ronaldo embarked on a new phase of 
         his career by signing with Italian Serie A club Juventus. <p></h3><hr size="6" color="red">

        <h3>Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, a small island off the western coast of the country. Ronaldo is the youngest of four children born 
        to Maria Dolores dos Santos and José Dinis Aveiro. He was named after Ronald Reagan, one of his father's favorite actors.Ronaldo grew up in a largely working class
        neighborhood in a small tin-roofed home that overlooked the ocean. Ronaldo was introduced to the game of soccer through his dad, who worked as an equipment manager
        at a boy's club.His early life was shaped by hardship, as his father often drank too much. To help keep the children fed and maintain some financial stability, Ronaldo's mother
        worked as a cook and cleaning person.</h3>
